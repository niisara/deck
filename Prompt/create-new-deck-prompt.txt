Infer the deck topic, category, and techniques from the filename provided. Then create a complete, production-ready deck file following ALL rules below. Use the existing decks in src/data/ (e.g. graph-retrieval-deck.tsx, chunking-techniques-deck.tsx) as style references.

---

## File Structure

```tsx
import type { Deck } from './types';
import SvgIcon from '../lib/icons/SvgIcon';
import { GSAPAnimated, GSAPStaggerList } from '../components/GSAPAnimated';
import { MermaidPopover } from '../components/MermaidPopover';

const iconStyle = { marginRight: '0.5rem', verticalAlign: 'middle' };

export const <camelCaseExportName>: Deck = {
  id: '<kebab-case-id>',
  name: '<N> <Topic Name>',
  description: '<one-line description>',
  category: '<one of: NLP | RAG | Fine Tuning | Agent | Demo | Personal | Inner Intelligence | Other>',
  theme: 'moon',
  cardClassName: 'glass-morphism',
  cardStyle: {
    backgroundImage: 'url(<UNSPLASH_URL>)',
    backgroundSize: 'cover',
    backgroundPosition: 'center',
  },
  slides: [],
  slideGroups: [],
};
```

After creating the file, add the import and the export name to src/data/decks.ts.

## Slide Groups Structure

### Group 1 — introduction
- Slide 1: Title slide (center: true). Show topic icon, audience, what you'll get, credits: "Prepared by: Nisar A / niisar.com".
- Slide 2: Overview — numbered grid of all techniques + MermaidPopover with graph TB showing technique categories.
- Slide 3: Why It Matters — motivation, pain points, where it fits in the ML/AI stack. MermaidPopover for pipeline/context diagram.

### Groups 2…N — one group per technique (id: technique-N-slug)
Each technique gets 4 slides:
| Slide | Suffix | Content |
|---|---|---|
| A | — Overview | 1-line definition, when to use, key intuition. MermaidPopover for core idea. |
| B | — How It Works | Step-by-step numbered breakdown. MermaidPopover for data/gradient flow. |
| C | — Pros & Cons | Two columns: ✅ Pros left (slideInLeft) / ❌ Cons right (slideInRight). |
| D | — Config & Tools | Key hyperparams/defaults, popular libraries/frameworks, quick-start hint. |

### Last Group — summary
- Slide 1: Cheat Sheet — decision table comparing all techniques (memory cost, compute cost, data needed, best use case).
- Slide 2: Key Takeaways — top 5 actionable bullets + call-to-action.

## GSAP Animation Rules

- Title slides → rotateIn on icon, scaleIn on headline, fadeIn on subtitle/credits.
- Lists → GSAPStaggerList with stagger 0.08–0.12.
- Two-column slides → slideInLeft + slideInRight for opposing columns.
- Key stats/numbers → bounceIn or scaleIn.
- Never repeat the same animation type on two consecutive slides.
- Every slide must have at least one animated element.
- Durations: quick items 0.5–0.7s, content blocks 0.7–0.9s, hero elements 0.9–1.2s.

---

## Speaker Notes (empty notes field — required on EVERY slide)

Format:
```
### [Slide Title]
[tone-tag] Opening hook / transition from previous slide.

#### [Section]
Full sentences. Simple words. 1–2 line analogy. Pronunciation guides on first mention.

#### When to Use This?
Practical scenarios in complete sentences.

#### Pros
Flowing description of benefits (no naked bullet lists).

#### Cons
Flowing description of drawbacks.

Closing sentence leading to the next slide.
```

Tone tags to vary: [cheerfully] [lecture] [conversational] [storytelling] [confidently] [seriously] [warmly] [energetic]

Pronunciation guide rules — phonetic only, NEVER expand the abbreviation:
- LoRA → LoRA 👉 'loh-rah'
- QLoRA → QLoRA 👉 'cue-loh-rah'
- RLHF → RLHF 👉 'are-el-aitch-eff'
- DPO → DPO 👉 'dee-pee-oh'
- PEFT → PEFT 👉 'peft'
- RAG → RAG 👉 'rag'
- LLM → LLM 👉 'el-el-em'
- CoT → CoT 👉 'see-oh-tee'
- ToT → ToT 👉 'tee-oh-tee'
- BM25 → BM25 👉 'bee-em-twenty-five'

---

## MermaidPopover Rules

- At least one MermaidPopover per technique group (more is better).
- Place inside the relevant <h4> tag:
  ```tsx
  <h4>
    How It Works
    <MermaidPopover title="LoRA Architecture" diagram={`graph LR ...`} />
  </h4>
  ```
- Color scheme: #4fc3f7 inputs (blue) · #81c784 outputs (green) · #ffcdd2 errors (red) · #ffd700 highlights (gold) · #e1bee7 special (purple).
- Keep diagrams simple — avoid complex nested subgraphs.

---

## Background Image

- Choose a UNIQUE Unsplash image not already used by any deck in src/data/.
- Must be dark/low-contrast so white text stays legible.
- Thematically relevant (e.g. fine-tuning → neural wires, gradient abstract; agents → dark web of nodes; RLHF → abstract feedback loop).
- Format: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-<ID>?w=1920&q=80
- Apply in TWO places:
  a) cardStyle.backgroundImage → with url() wrapper
  b) slideGroups[0].slides[0].backgroundImage → without url() wrapper (same URL)
- Set color: '#fff' on text containers for dark backgrounds.

## Register in decks.ts

After writing the deck file, add the import and insert the export name into the decks array in src/data/decks.ts.
