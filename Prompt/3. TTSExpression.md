## Guidelines

1. **Place emotion tags at the beginning** of sentences or paragraphs to set the tone
2. **Use vocal effect tags mid-sentence** for natural reactions
3. **Tags should enhance, not distract** - let clear text speak for itself
4. **Use punctuation** (ellipses, dashes, exclamation marks) to reinforce delivery
5. **Don't over-tag** - avoid tagging every sentence
6. **Match the content's emotional arc** - vary tags throughout the presentation
7. **Keep speaker notes clean** - don't include slide numbers

## Best Practices for Educational Content

- Speaker notes should start with `### Title` (no slide numbers)
- Tags work best when they match the natural flow of speech
- Rhetorical questions benefit from appropriate questioning tones
- Transitions between topics should have corresponding emotional shifts
