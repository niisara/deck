LLM Agent Architectures — ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, Reflexion, Self-Ask, MRKL — the "13 techniques" cheat-sheet format works perfectly here.

Agent Memory Systems — In-context memory, external memory (vector stores), episodic memory, semantic memory, procedural memory — when to use each, implementation patterns.

Tool Use & Function Calling — Tool selection strategies, parallel tool calls, tool chaining, error recovery, JSON schema design, OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini API patterns.

Agent Planning Techniques — Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, Graph-of-Thought, MCTS, HuggingGPT-style decomposition.

Multi-Agent Systems — Orchestrator/subagent patterns, AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph — task delegation, communication protocols, consensus mechanisms.

Agentic RAG — Query decomposition agents, iterative retrieval, self-correcting RAG, adaptive retrieval strategies. Ties directly into your existing RAG decks.

Agent Evaluation & Reliability — Trajectory evaluation, tool call accuracy, hallucination in agents, AgentBench, τ-bench metrics.

Agent Safety & Guardrails — Prompt injection attacks, tool sandboxing, output validation, human-in-the-loop checkpoints, scope limiting.
