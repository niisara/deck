"That joke was [laughing] absolutely hilarious!"
Interruptions and flow:

"[cautiously] Hello, is this seat-"
"[jumping in] Free? [cheerfully] Yes it is!"

"[indecisive] Hi, can I get uhhh..."
"[quizzically] The usual?"

Guidelines:

Place emotion tags at the beginning of sentences or paragraphs to set the tone
Use vocal effect tags mid-sentence for natural reactions
Tags should enhance the meaning, not distract from it
Use punctuation (ellipses, dashes, exclamation marks) to reinforce the delivery
Don't over-tag - let the text carry meaning where it's already clear
Task:
Review the speaker notes and add appropriate audio tags that match the content's emotional arc and intended impact. Make the narration feel natural, expressive, and engaging while staying true to the message.
